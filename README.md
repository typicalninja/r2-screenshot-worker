# r2-screenshot-worker

A Cloudflare Worker that captures screenshots of webpages and stores them in a Cloudflare R2 bucket for fast, persistent access.

[![Deploy to cloudflare workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](cloudflare-deploy-url)
## Getting Started


#### 1. Deploy the Worker

You can deploy this worker using the Cloudflare dashboard or the Wrangler CLI. **The easiest way is to click the button above.**

### Deploy with Wrangler CLI

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/typicalninja/r2-screenshot-worker.git

cd r2-screenshot-worker
```

2. Create the R2 bucket:


```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create website-screenshot-bucket
```
> You may choose a different name, but make sure to update it in `wrangler.jsonc`


3. Set environment variables

In your `wrangler.jsonc` or through the Cloudflare dashboard, set the following environment variables:

- SECRET_KEY - Secret used to verify requests
- CORS_ORIGIN - CORS origin to allow; default is *
- BROWSER_USER_AGENT - User agent string used by the browser


4. Deploy the worker

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```


## Example Request

To capture a screenshot, send a `GET` request to the `/` endpoint with the following query parameters:

- `url`: (Required) URL to capture (must be URL-encoded)
- `expireAt`: 	(Required) Expiration timestamp in milliseconds (UNIX epoch)
- `sig`: 	(Required) HMAC signature for request validation
- `fullPage`: (Optional) Set to true to capture the entire scrollable page

> Note: expireAt only applies during signature validation. If the screenshot already exists in R2, it is returned regardless of expiration.

### Signing requests

To prevent tampering, requests must be signed using HMAC (SHA-256) with your secret key (`SECRET_KEY`).


```js
import crypto from 'crypto';

const SECRET = 'your_secret_key_here';
const site = 'https://example.com';
const fullPage = false;
const expireAt = Date.now() + 60_000; // Expires in 60 seconds

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  site,
  expireAt: expireAt.toString(),
  ...(fullPage ? { fullPage: 'true' } : {}),
});

const dataToSign = params.toString();
const sig = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET)
  .update(dataToSign)
  .digest('base64')
  .replace(/\+/g, '-')
  .replace(/\//g, '_')
  .replace(/=+$/, '');

params.set('sig', sig);

const signedUrl = `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/?${params.toString()}`;
console.log('Signed URL:', signedUrl);
```

### Response format

```jsonc
{
    // the objectName within r2
    // to retrieve the image use GET <r2 url>/<objectName>
    "objectName:" "screenshots/something*****",
    "created": false, // false = served from cache, true = newly created
}
```

### How it works

When the request is received, the worker will:
1. check for the `site` parameter in the query string.
2. convert the `site` parameter to a object name by sha256 hashing it and appending the `.webp` extension.
3. check if the screenshot already exists in the R2 bucket.
4. If it exists, it will return the existing screenshot.
5. If it does not exist, proceed to validate the request signature using the `sig` and `expireAt` parameters.
6. If the signature is valid, it will use Puppeteer to launch a headless browser, navigate to the specified URL, and take a screenshot. If `fullPage` is set to `true`, it will capture the entire page; otherwise, it will capture only the viewport.
6. The screenshot will be stored in the R2 bucket with the object name.
7. Finally, it will return a JSON response with the object name and a success status.
